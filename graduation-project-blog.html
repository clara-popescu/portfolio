        <!-- <p class="blog-entry-text">I've brainstormed a couple of ideas that relate to the topics above and others that are a bit random, but I think would be cool to explore. They are quite vague and some of them seem impossible to make by myself. 
        <br><br>1) The first idea I had explores the concept of <i>consuming</i> content on the internet. Combining this with my passion for food, I want to visualise the amount of media we consume in a physical space with stuff that we actually consume for our basic needs. I want to explore the relations and psychological impact that using these words (extensively) such as 'consuming' for non essential stuff (like social media) has on our brains. Historically, this word has been used for different purposes.
